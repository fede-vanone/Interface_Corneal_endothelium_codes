The folder Model_simulation contains the codes for running the model of the corneal 
endothelium, to compute quantities of interest (concentrations, potential, 
fluxes,...) and to plot some figures.

The folder Membrane_permeability_plots contains the codes for running the model 
with different values of membrane and tight junction water permeabilities. These
codes can be used to assess the impact of such permeabilities on some quantity
of interest (for example water flux). There is also the option to switch off
electro-osmosis, to evaluate its role against local osmosis.

Optimization_set1 contains the codes for optimizing the channel permeabilities 
on the cellular domain. This is how set 1 was obtained. 

Optimization_set2 contains the codes for optimizing the channel permeabilities 
on the whole domain. This is how set 2 was obtained. 

The folder SA_cell contains the codes for the sensitivity analysis on the cellular domain.

The folder SA contains the codes to run the sensitivity analysis on the full domain.
